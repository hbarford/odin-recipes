    <ol type="1">
        <li>Combine the chili garlic sauce, soy sauce, and brown sugar 
            in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the ground pork to a skillet and cook over medium heat 
            until it is fully browned. Once browned, add the prepared 
            dragon sauce and chopped peanuts. Allow the pork and peanuts 
            to simmer in the sauce for another 5 minutes, or until the 
            sauce has reduced by half.</li>
        <li>While the pork is browning, begin boiling water for your noodles. 
            Once boiling, add your noodles and cook according to the package 
            directions. Drain the noodles in a colander.</li>
        <li>Once the sauce has reduced and the noodles have drained, add 
            the noodles to the skillet and toss until everything is 
            combined and coated in sauce. Top with sliced green onions and 
            serve!</li>
