# odin-recipes
A quick and dirty recipe repository

Just like in the kitchen, you're going to make a mess before you make something tasty. Right? 

The goal: Make a functional (but not pretty) website for listing recipes. Yum!

I will learn: 
-[] HTML basics
-[] How to use github for basic version control
-[] Iteration!
